## Pre-requisites

Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

## Installation

``bash
npm install -g generator-ibm-service-enablement
``

## Usage

Following command line arguments are supported
* `--bluemix {stringified-json}` -  used by Scaffolder to supply project information from `pman`. For an example of a bluemix.json look at the [fallback_bluemix.js](./generators/app/fallback_bluemix.js) file.

## Development

Clone this repository and link it via npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer/generator-ibm-service-enablement
cd generator-ibm-service-enablement
npm link
```

In a separate directory invoke the generator via

```bash
yo ibm-service-enablement
```

## Adding new services

To add a new services you will need to follow these steps.

Create a new composed generated by adding a service folder under generators with the prefix service- then the service id of your new service. To illustrate, if service called S3 needs to be added the folder would be called service-s3.

Under this service there is one folder named templates where you will store your templates per language. Currently, we support java-liberty, java-spring, node, python, and swift. If there is a language that you do not support make an issue.

Add an index.js file using the following structure

```
'use strict';
const BaseGenerator = require('../lib/generatorbase');
const SCAFFOLDER_PROJECT_PROPERTY_NAME = ''; //the key name for your service provided to you by our scaffolder team
const CLOUD_FOUNDRY_SERVICE_NAME = ''; // the key name for your service provided to you by Cloud Foundry
const CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY = '' // a custom key name for your service that will be used if you prefer not to use the SCAFFOLDER_PROJECT_PROPERTY_NAME
const CUSTOM_CRED_KEYS = []; // an array of custom credentila key names for a service

const config = {
	cloudFoundryIsArray: true,
	mappingVersion: 1
};

module.exports = class extends BaseGenerator {
	constructor(args, opts) {
		super(args, opts, SCAFFOLDER_PROJECT_PROPERTY_NAME, CLOUD_FOUNDRY_SERVICE_NAME, CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY, CUSTOM_CRED_KEYS);
	}

	initializing() {
		return super.initializing();
	}

	configuring() {
		return super.configuring(config);
	}

	writing() {
		return super.writing();
	}
};
```

* The **SCAFFOLDER_PROJECT_PROPERTY_NAME** is provided by the IBM Bluemix User Experience. If your service does not exist please make an issue
so we can accomodate your service. If your service is provisioned using Cloud Foundry set the *CLOUD_FOUNDRY_SERVICE_NAME* using the service name
from **VCAP_SERVICES** (e.g `cloudantNoSQLDB`).

* The **CLOUD_FOUNDRY_SERVICE_NAME** is provided by **CLOUD FOUNDRY** via the **VCAP_SERVICES** when you 
provision a service. 

* The **CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY** is the service key that can be used in place of the keys provided by Scaffolder. An example of these keys can be 
found under `test/resources/mappings.json` Note 

* The **CUSTOM_CRED_KEYS** is an array of credential keys for each service. If this is left empty the keys then the service will use the credentials keys given by Scaffolder. 
These credentials keys can be found under test/resources/mappings.json

### Mappings

The mappings.json file is what service-enablement uses to find the credentials for each service in the generated app. 
There are three main locations by default: **cloudfoundry**, **env**, and **file**. 
This file will be autogenerated based on the **SCAFFOLDER_PROJECT_PROPERTY_NAME**, **CLOUD_FOUNDRY_SERVICE_NAME**, **CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY**,**CUSTOM_CRED_KEYS** and **cloudFoundryisArray**.
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is the template engine used to generate the files.

### LocalDevConfig

The localdev-config file is designed for running your services locally on your machine. If your application was not generated through the IBM Bluemix User Experience you will have to provide 
the credentials for your service(s) manually. To do this you can add the services as options when running the generator. Here is an example.

`yo ibm-service-enablement --bluemix file:./bluemixMock.json`

```
		# bluemixMock.json
		{
			"CUSTOM_SERVICE_KEY": {
				"username": "HayataShin",
				"password": "MotherSuna123!",
				"url: "http://ninpocho.com/api",
				"serviceInfo": {
					"cloudLabel": "CLOUD_FOUNDRY_NAME",
					"label": "service-label",
					"name" "service-name",
					"plan": "service-plan"
				}

			}
		}
```


### Processing credentials

The following table provides the dependency modules used to process the service properties for each service. Currently, the Java maven module is under development.

+----------+------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Language |       Name       |                   Repository                   |
+----------+------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Node     | ibm-cloud-env    | https://www.npmjs.com/package/ibm-cloud-env    |
| Python   | ibmcloudenv      | https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibmcloudenv/0.1.3 |
| Swift    | CloudEnvironment | https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-cfenv       |
+----------+------------------+------------------------------------------------+


## Testing

To run the unit tests

`npm test`

To run integration tests

`npm run integration`

**Note** You will need to mock the credentials by adding a `bluemix.int.json` file. The file content should look something like the following:

```
{
  "cloudant": [
		{
			"url": "XXXX",
			"username": "XXXXX",
			"password": "XXXX",
			"serviceInfo": {
				"label": "cloudant-label",
				"name": "cloudant-name",
				"plan": "cloudant-plan"
			}
		}
	],

	"objectStorage": [
		{
			"auth_url": "XXXX",
			"domainId": "XXXXX",
			"domainName": "XXXX",
			"password": "XXXX",
			"project": "XXXXX",
			"projectId": "XXXX",
			"region": "dallas",
			"role": "admin",
			"userId": "XXXX",
			"username": "XXXX",
			"serviceInfo": {
				"label": "object-storage-label",
				"name": "object-storage-name",
				"plan": "object-storage-plan"
			}
		}
	]

}
```

## Publishing Changes

In order to publish changes, you will need to fork the repository or ask to join the `ibm-developer` org and branch off the `master` branch.

Make sure to follow the [conventional commit specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) before contributing. To help you with commit a commit template is provide. Run `config.sh` to initialize the commit template to your `.git/config` or use [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)

Once you are finished with your changes, run `npm test` to make sure all tests pass.

Do a pull request against `master`, make sure the build passes. A team member will review and merge your pull request.
Once merged to `master` an auto generated pull request will be created against master to update the changelog. Make sure that the CHANGELOG.md and the package.json is correct before merging the pull request. After the auto generated pull request has been merged to `master` the version will be bumped and published to npm.
